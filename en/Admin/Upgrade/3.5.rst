Version 3.5
===========

What's changed ?
----------------

  * Email address are now a primary key for users ; two users can not have the 
    same email address

  * There is no more Publication through the MetaWeblog API 
    (Wordpress, Blogger...). We encourage the use of our APIs.

  * The publication system has been completely re-written, see the newt chapter.


What's New ?
------------

  This is the exciting part !

  * APIs : You can now access Phraseanet through RESTfull APIs.

  * Bridge : a brand new component which allow you to send your document to 
    other applications like Youtube, Dailymotion...

  * Feeds : We re-designed the Feed publication component. You can now cretae 
    many feeds and work with it outside the Phraseanet

  * Core redesign : We rewrite a part of the core, and we'll continue. If you
    are a developer, you will see that Phraseanet is now built on top of many 
    Symfony Components.

  * SphinxSearch : You can now substitute the default Phraseanet engine with
    SphinxSearch
